# Skånetrafiken DirectLogin

A script that will login to Skånetrafiken WiFi without needing to access their login portal. Skånetrafiken's portal is really slow and 50% of the time it does not show up, therefore it is a lot faster to access it without needing to use the portal.

## Installation

Clone this repo.

```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/lukaspalm/Skanetrafiken-Directlogin.git
```

Change directory to Skanetrafiken-DirectLogin and install requirements

```bash
cd Skanetrafiken-DirectLogin
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Firstly you need to connect to a WiFi called *Skånetrafiken*. When connecting, the message "an action is needed", "you need to login" or something similar is displayed. When this shows up you run the script inside of the *Skånetrafiken-Directlogin/*  folder.  

Run the script when inside of the folder like this:


```bash
python login.py
```
